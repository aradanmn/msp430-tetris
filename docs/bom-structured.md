# MSP430 Handheld Gaming Console — Structured BOM (Multi-Level)
_Revision: C — 2026-03-21_

A structured (multi-level) BOM expresses the product as a parent-child hierarchy. Each sub-assembly is broken down into its constituent components. **Qty** is per-parent (not aggregate) — to get total procurement quantities see `bom-flat.md`.

Level key: **L0** = top-level assembly · **L1** = sub-assembly · **L2** = purchased component

## Build Phase Map

Phases indicate when each sub-assembly is added to the physical prototype. The structured BOM above is the complete product — not all sub-assemblies are present at every phase.

| Phase | Sub-assembly | Lessons |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | L1 1.0 MCU only (LaunchPad bare) | 01–05 |
| 2 | + L1 2.0 Display + L1 3.0 Memory + L1 7.0 Prototyping Platform | 06–10 |
| 3 | + L1 4.0 Input | 11–13 |
| 4 | + L1 5.0 Audio | 14–15 |
| 5 | + L1 6.0 Power (portable operation) | 16–20 |

## SPI Bus Allocation

All SPI devices share USCI_B0 on the MSP430G2553. CS pins are the only differentiators.

| Device | SCLK | MOSI | MISO | CS | DC | RST |
|--------|------|------|------|----|----|-----|
| SSD1325 OLED (2.1) | P1.5 | P1.7 | — | P2.0 | P2.1 | P2.2 |
| 23LC1024 SRAM (3.1) | P1.5 | P1.7 | P1.6 | P2.3 | — | — |
| W25Q32 Flash (3.2) | P1.5 | P1.7 | P1.6 | P2.4 | — | — |
| SN74HC165N input (4.1) | P1.5 | — | P1.6 | P2.5 (PL) | — | — |

> **Note:** P1.6 is also LED2 on the LaunchPad. Remove the LED2 jumper when using SPI.
> WP and HOLD pins on the 23LC1024 and W25Q32 should be tied to 3.3V.
